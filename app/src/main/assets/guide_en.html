    With Debitum you can track all kinds of IOUs, be it money or lent items. This way you will never more forget if your friend already gave you back that book or dispute about how much you owe your colleague for coffee.
</p>
<p>
    There is no online service whatsoever involved, so your data is saved on your device only (as far as this app is concerned).
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<h4>Creating Transactions</h4>
<p>
    To take note of lent money or items, create a transaction using the red button. A Dialog appears, where you can enter details like amount, description or date and switch between a money- or an item-transaction (use the switch to the right of the amount input field).
</p>

<h4>Transaction Lists</h4>
<p>
    Choose transaction views at the bottom:
</p>
<h5>People</h5>
<p>
    Transactions summarized by person, ordered by last transaction date
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tap a row to filter money and items by that person</li>
    <li>Create persons from the menu here, or with the "+" button while adding a new transaction</li>
</ul>
<h5>Money</h5>
<p>
    Shows only monetary transactions, by date (descending). To create a repayment, long-tap the initial transaction and select the repay menu item. This will create a matching repayment transaction. For details why there is no "mark returned" functionality like there is for items, see <a href="https://github.com/Marmo/debitum/issues/9#issuecomment-861314762">here</a>.
</p>
<h5>Items</h5>
<p>
    Shows only lent items, by date (descending). To mark items as returned, long-press them and choose "Mark as returned" from the menu bar. The list can be filtered by returned, unreturned, or all items.
</p>
<p>
    Long-press any row in any list for its contextual menu. Edit, delete items or select multiple rows this way. In the "Person"- and "Money" list it shows the sum of all selected rows.
</p>
<p>
    To create a copy of an existing transaction or use one as a preset, select it and tap the "+" button. The create-transaction-dialog will be pre-filled with the values of the selected transaction.
</p>

<h4>Linking Contacts</h4>
<p>
    The "Edit person" Dialog allows linking existing phone contacts to persons. Click "No linked contact" and choose one. Currently, the only effect is, that the contact's photo (if present) is shown in the "Person" list.
</p>

<h4>Backup and restore</h4>
<p>
    Back up and restore the database (of all transactions and persons) from the settings to/from a location of your choice.
</p>

<h3>Permissions</h3>
<h4>Read contacts</h4>
<p>
    Used for linking phone contacts to persons. You can safely deny this permission and use Debitum without linking contacts.
