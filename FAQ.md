With Debitum you can track all kinds of IOUs, be it money or lent items. This way you will never more forget if your friend already gave you back that book or dispute about how much you owe your colleague for coffee.

## Will Debitum keep my data safe?
There is no online service whatsoever involved, so your data is saved on your device only (as far as this app is concerned). The app's data is nonetheless available to be backed up by Androids backup service, so if you activated these backups, your Debitum data will be backed up to wherever Google wants.

# Usage
## What is a transaction in terms of Debitum?
A transaction records money or things you receive or give away, including details as date, a comment/description and images.

## How can I create transactions?
Create a transaction using the red button. A dialog appears, where you can enter details like amount, description or date and switch between a money- or an item-transaction (use the switch to the right of the amount input field).

When the list is currently filtered by a person or when exactly one person in the "People" view is selected, the Person field in the create-transaction-dialog will be pre-filled with this person.

## How can I filter for money- or item-transactions?
Use the tabs in the bottom navigation ("Money" or "Items").

## How can I list the transactions of one person?
Tap a row in the "People" view to filter money and items by that person.

## How can I record an item was returned?
To mark items as returned, long-press the respective transaction in the items list and choose "Mark as returned" from the menu bar. The list can be filtered by returned, unreturned, or all items.

## How can I record repaid money?
To create a repayment, long-tap the initial transaction and select the repay menu item. This will create a matching repayment transaction. For details why there is no "mark returned" functionality like there is for items, see <a href="https://github.com/Marmo/debitum/issues/9#issuecomment-861314762">here</a>.

## How can I edit or delete a transaction or a person?
Long-press the row to be edited to get its contextual menu. Edit or delete a transaction/person or select multiple rows this way. 

## How can I quickly calculate the sum of a subset of all shown money transactions or persons's totals?  
Select all rows of interest in the "Person"- or "Money" list. The sum of the selected rows will be shown in the header bar.

## How can I create a copy of an existing transaction?
To create a copy of an existing transaction or use one as a preset, select it and tap the "+" button. The create-transaction-dialog will be pre-filled with the values of the selected transaction.

## How can I link a person to a contact on my phone?
The "Edit person" Dialog allows linking existing phone contacts to persons. Click "No linked contact" and choose one. Currently, the only effect is, that the contact's photo (if present) is shown in the "Person" list.

## How can I backup my data?
Select "backup data" from the settings. A file picker will be shown to select the backup location.

## What will be backed up?
People, transactions, image attachments and settings.

## How can I restore a perviously created backup?
Select "restore data" from the settings. A file picker will be shown to select the backup file to restore.
